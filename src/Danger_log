A few detailed assumptions:
  1. A user can only use <transactions> to query or cancel his own orders
  2. the value of amount attr can not be 0, since it makes no sence to buy or sell nothing
  3. server can not match buy/sell from the same account
  4. If the <cancel> tag or <query> tag has do not id attributes, they will print a error message and will not print any results.
